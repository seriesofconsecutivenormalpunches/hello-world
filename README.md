If this is a nooby thing, it's a necessary nooby thing. 

Easily discoverable person here, I've been coerced into writing this by a very personable robot aptly named Hubot. He told me to say a few things about moon tacos and their taste compared to Earth tacos, but I like to think our tacos are okay, just as Toy Story 2 was okay. 

Here's a bit about me: I am so new to the far reaching concept of all things code that a repository still flashbulbs images of old time miners in my head. But, the greater scheme of code grows so fast, that all of us are young as belly-people too I'm sure. Besides, every new commit (that's right I said it,) gives me a learners-high that is both manic and joyous, things I have never felt so exactly before. Being new is why I could never finish Oblivion without creating an unpolished first level character again.
